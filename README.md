## About Me

Iâ€™m Shanzy Saleem, a passionate UI/UX designer and WordPress developer with a flair for crafting digital experiences that balance elegance and usability. I believe every design should tell a story â€” one that connects users emotionally and makes their journey effortless.

With years of experience transforming ideas into intuitive interfaces, I specialize in creating responsive, accessible, and visually compelling websites that empower brands and delight users.

## What I Do

- **User Interface Design:** Creating clean, modern, and user-friendly layouts using the latest design principles and tools.  
- **User Experience Strategy:** Focusing on seamless interactions and intuitive flows that boost engagement and retention.  
- **WordPress Development:** Building robust, scalable WordPress sites, custom themes, and plugins that perfectly fit client needs.  
- **Responsive Design:** Ensuring flawless performance across all devices and screen sizes.  
- **Collaboration:** Working closely with clients and developers to deliver pixel-perfect results on time.

## My Toolbox

| Design                | Development              | Collaboration           |
|-----------------------|--------------------------|-------------------------|
| Figma, Adobe XD, Sketch | WordPress, PHP, HTML, CSS, JavaScript | Git, GitHub, Slack, Trello |

## My Approach

Design is more than aesthetics â€” itâ€™s about empathy and understanding real usersâ€™ needs. I dive deep into user research and feedback to craft experiences that feel natural and enjoyable.

Iâ€™m a strong believer in **clean code, reusable components, and scalable architecture**, ensuring that every website is easy to maintain and extend.

## A Glimpse Into My Process

> Sketches and wireframes are the roots from which great designs grow. I believe in starting with solid foundations, iterating with feedback, and refining every detail for perfection.

## Sample Code Snippet

Hereâ€™s a simple example of how I keep my code clean and approachable â€” a styled button that invites interaction:

<button style="background-color:#F78FB3; color:white; padding:10px 20px; border:none; border-radius:5px; cursor:pointer;">
  Click Me
</button>
